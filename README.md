# DinoAutoJump

I saw a hardware based Dino bot and wanted to recreate it... but I only know code. So I built a pure JS vision sensor that lives in the DOM. Same same but different.


# Steps to run the script

1. Copy the `dino.js` code.
2. Open chrome://dino.
3. Click Inspect and go to Console.
4. Paste the code and run it in console.
